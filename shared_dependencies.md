1. "main.py" and "calculator.py":
   - Function Names: The main.py file will likely call functions from the calculator.py file. These could include basic operations like `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`, etc.

2. "main.py" and "tests/test_calculator.py":
   - Function Names: The test_calculator.py file will also call the same functions from the calculator.py file for testing purposes. These could include the same basic operations like `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`, etc.
   - Test Function Names: The test_calculator.py file will contain test functions that are specific to testing, such as `test_add()`, `test_subtract()`, `test_multiply()`, `test_divide()`, etc. These function names will be unique to the test_calculator.py file but are related to the function names in the calculator.py file.

3. "calculator.py" and "tests/test_calculator.py":
   - Function Names: As mentioned above, the test_calculator.py file will call the functions defined in the calculator.py file for testing purposes. These could include the same basic operations like `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`, etc.
